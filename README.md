# Hello‚úåüèº

In the process of studying and working, I actively develop technical skills and soft skills, striving for mastery in new technologies and solving complex problems. I am open to feedback and value teamwork, seeing criticism as a tool for personal growth. I work tirelessly on myself, striving to become a valuable member of the team, constantly improving my skills.

Always happy to chat about technical topics or pick up something new.
