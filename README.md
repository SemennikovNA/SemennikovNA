# Hello‚úåüèº

I have application development experience like independently and in a team. I like challenging tasks that help develop my professional skills. I have excellent time management management, I show persistence in achieving goals, I value teamwork and I can find non-standard solutions. Always I take responsibility for the result and am ready to learning. Open to feedback, I perceive criticism as a personal tool growth. I always strive for self-improvement, constantly developing my professional skills and improving my knowledge.
