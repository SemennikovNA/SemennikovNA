# Hello‚úåüèº

I show a high level of curiosity and diverse interests. I actively interact with information, strive for self-development and have an open mind.

This is what I would write if I didn‚Äôt care about my resume and did it via chatGPTüòÅ

My name is Nikita and I recently moved from Moscow to Kazakhstan. I am interested in active sports, predominantly swimming and hockey.
I got into development because I always liked doing things with my own hands, it was interesting to learn new things and put them into practice. I value open communication and treat criticism as an opportunity for growth. I strive to become a valuable member of the team by constantly improving my skills.
I devote my free time to reading technical literature, participate in team development of mobile applications in the DevRush community, and have extensive experience working in a team with other developers and designers.

Always happy to chat about technical topics or pick up something new.
